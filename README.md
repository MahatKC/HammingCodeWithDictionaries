# HammingCodeWithDictionaries

Project developed in 2020 as an assignment for a Computer Organization and Architecture class.

The input is a single number with the number of N lines that will follow.

Then, N lines with 21-bit binary numbers are provided. The 16 first bits correspond to the bit values and the final 5 to the parity values.

The output are the corrected binary numbers.
